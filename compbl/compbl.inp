0       ! 0 = constant viscosity, 1 = Sutherland
0.001   ! Viscosity,mu (makes delta=1)
0.3     ! Mach number
1.0     ! Prandtl number
0.0     ! Beta
1000    ! Re_delta
n       ! write on a grid (y,n)
t       ! (t)emporal or (s)patial

Notes:
  1. This is input for the COMPBL compressible boundary layer solver
  2. This is very similar (but not exactly the same) as the case from
     Collis Ph.D. thesis, chapter 4
